# Module Challenge 1

# Kickstarter challenge

## Overview of Project:
In the first challenge, I made a chart to visualize the outcomes of the campaigns in a pivot chart. In the second challenge, I made a line chart showing the percentage of the outcomes reaching a goal amount.

## Challenge 1: 
The pivot chart shows the theater outcomes of each month of the year. Months May and June show an increase in succesful outcomes. Months Jan. and Dec. show a decrease in succussful shows. October had a peak in failed shows.
